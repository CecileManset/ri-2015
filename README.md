5IL INSA Project
================

Search engine for movie-related documents based on a customized ontology specialized on the movie "Intouchables". 

The search engine returns a list of documents, sorted by relevance according to its criteria. This is done with a list of 9 predefined requests related to the "Intouchables" movie. The goal of the project is to compare these results with a list of relevant documents established by a human being and to have the highest correlation rate.

For instance, for the request "lieu, naissance, Omar Sy", our search engine, after querying our ontology using SPARQL, looks for documents containing directly "Trappes" which is Omar Sy place of birth.
